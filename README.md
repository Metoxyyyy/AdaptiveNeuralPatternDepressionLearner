# AdaptiveNeuralPatternDepressionLearner (ANPDL)

A Neural Network for Pattern Recognition and Addition using Depression Learning

## Overview
This project implements a neural network that uses depression learning for pattern recognition and simple arithmetic operations. The network is particularly efficient at learning addition patterns through a depression-based learning mechanism.

## Features
- Pattern recognition using neural networks
- Depression-based learning algorithm
- Addition operations learning
- Adaptive weight adjustment
- Pattern visualization tools
